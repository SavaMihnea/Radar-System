# Radar-System

This project involves constructing a radar system using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, integrated with the Processing 4.3 application. Designed to emulate a detection system, it utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to identify objects within a range of up to 40 centimeters, relying on sound waves for precise detection.

processing_code_radar.pde is the code for the Processing 4.3 app.

processing_code_radar.pde is the code for the Arduino Uno app.

The code is commented, easy to follow and understand.
